# bounce-game

A Python game where you guide a bouncing ball through rotating obstacles. Actually, I designed this game as a school project 4 years ago (I obviously overthought what the teacher was asking for). I recently found it on my computer and thought it would be fun to share.

  

# How to run

You just need to run `main.py`.

  

# Game rules

The game has several levels.

 In Each Level:

- A ball starts on the launch pad.

- Around the target position, there is a rotating circle of obstacles.

- The target position and the obstacles around it move in repetitive patterns.

- Each obstacle has a color.

- Your ball can only pass through obstacles that have the **same color** as the ball.

- The ball will bounce off all other obstacles.

- There are also additional obstacles placed around the plane to make the bounces more interesting.

- You can retry the level by clicking the purple retry button after you lose.

- If your ball bounces back to the launch pad, the current level will reset.

  

In the first few levels, extra obstacles may appear with a small probability.

In later levels, extra obstacles will always appear.

  

**Goal:** Make the ball touch the rotating obstacle that has the same color as the ball.
